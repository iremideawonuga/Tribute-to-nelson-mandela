     <h3>About</h3>
     <p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (/mænˈdɛlə/ man-DEH-lə;[1] Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; born Rolihlahla Mandela; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid activist
         and politician who served as the first president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a full representative democratic election.
          His government focused on dismantling the legacy of 
         apartheid by fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.</p>
